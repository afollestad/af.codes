      <h4>SkillFitness&reg;</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">I adapted the already-existing iOS version to Android. SkillFitness&reg; helps professionals reach their full potential through training, collaboration, and self-discovery. It's quickly being developed to other professional and non-professional fields. It's available on both <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skillfitness.skillfitness'>Android</a> and <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skillfitness/id787386054'>iOS</a>, your company needs to be signed up in order to have credentials to login.</p><img class="app-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/ui-showcase/master/sfshowcase.png">

      <h4>Polar Dashboard</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Polar is a dashboard developed by me and designed by <a href="https://plus.google.com/+TomWellington24">Tom Wellington</a>. Tom came to me with the need for a new dashboard to be used in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wellingtomworks.gaufrer">Gaufrer</a>. Polar is designed to be different, beautiful, and professional. It also happens to be very easily configurable. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard">GitHub repo</a> and <a href="http://afollestad.github.io/polar-dashboard/">Getting Started guide</a>.</p><img class="app-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/polar-dashboard/gh-pages/showcase.png?token=ABvGBdL28ue5kkkTc3-nHzYZOxsE83W9ks5Wt4VtwA%3D%3D">

      <h4>Polar Request Manager</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Polar Request Manager is a web-based and subscription based icon request management system that I designed for Polar Dashboard users. Rather than receiving emails, designers receive organized icon requests from an online dashboard which shows how many times an app's icon has been requested, along with whether or not you've completed the request. It can even generate appfilters for you. You can register an account on <a href="https://polar.aidanfollestad.com">polar.aidanfollestad.com</a>.</p><img class="app-image" src="https://polar.aidanfollestad.com/images/intro_apps.png">

      <h4>Nock Nock</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Nock Nock is a very simple app which allows developers to monitor their web servers to make sure they are up. The app will "knock" on the door of your web server on a chosen interval (<em>it actually makes a GET request</em>) to see if it responds and returns a successful response code. If it does not, you are notified. Nock Nock is on <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.nocknock'>Google Play</a>, it's also <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/nock-nock'>open source</a>.</p><img class="app-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/nock-nock/master/art/showcasemain.png">

      <h4>PhotoAffix</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">PhotoAffix makes it easy to stitch multiple photos together, horizontally or vertically. The image below is an example of what it can do. It's currently in beta, you can <a href='https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.afollestad.photoaffix'>opt-in to Google Play Beta Testing</a>, or download an APK from the <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/photo-affix'>open source repository</a>.</p><img class="app-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/photo-affix/master/art/pashowcase1.png">

      <h4>Boid for Twitter</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">This is the first major project I had worked on. I had originally been working on another Twitter app called <em>Peeper</em> as an experiment, but <a href="https://twitter.com/redbullcat" target="_blank">Philip Oakley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gmph" target="_blank">Graham MacPhee</a> contacted me over email with design mockups and ideas for a new Twitter application for Android. I became their coder and we worked on Boid for quite some time while it spread like a virus and got almost 50,000 downloads. <a href="https://twitter.com/kennydude" target="_blank">Joe Simpson</a> joined our team as another coder to help me out. We eventually had to take the project down from Google Play because Twitter changed their API policies and Boid became too much to maintain and update. You can find information about this project by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Boid+for+Android" target="_blank">searching Google</a>.</p><img class="app-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/ui-showcase/master/boid.png">

      <h4>Material Dialogs</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">This library is a solution I had to using Material design themed dialogs across all versions of Android, not just Lollipop.

      <h4>Material Camera</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Video recording is one of the hardest things to do for Android developers. Compatibility is very inconsistent among many different devices (due to different Android versions, how manufacturers mount camera sensors, etc.). This library is a result of research and testing done during development of SkillFitness. The project is <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/material-camera'>available on GitHub</a>, along with a tutorial and Gradle dependency.</p><img class="app-image-small" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afollestad/material-camera/master/art/showcase.png">

      <h4>DragSelectRecyclerView</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Google Photos made multi-selection by dragging your finger popular. I needed a solution to do this in Photo Affix, so this was the result. The project is <a href='https://github.com/afollestad/drag-select-recyclerview'>available on GitHub</a>, and there's also a <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afollestad.dragselectrecyclerviewsample'>sample on Google Play</a>.</p>
