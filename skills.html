            <h4>Drums</h4>
            <p class="flow-text">I've played the drums since I was very young. I played percussion in elementary school, junior high school, and for two years of high school. I've played and performed with two bands in the past. Listening to and playing music is one of my
                major passions.</p>
            <h4>Snowboarding</h4>
            <p class="flow-text">My dad got me into snowboarding when I was very young. It's not quite a profession for me compared to my other skills, it's just a hobby, but I love it. I went to Colorado in the winter of 2013 with my dad.</p>
