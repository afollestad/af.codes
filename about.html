            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p class="flow-text">
                My name is Aidan Follestad, I'm a young full-stack software developer based in the Twin Cities (St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN). I have experience with many languages and frameworks, ranging from Android, to websites, to backend servers.
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text">
                Aside from programming, I have other various hobbies/interests including PC gaming and Virtual Reality, drone flying (I have a DJI Mavic Pro), snowboarding, playing the drums, politics, and cars (I drive a Mk6 VW GTI). I'm also a huge music guy; I love
                rock, metal, post hardcore, and alternative music.

            <h4>School</h4>
            <p class="flow-text">
                I graduated from <a href="http://central.spps.org" target="_blank">Central Senior High School</a> with the Class of 2014; I attended the <a href="https://www.uwstout.edu" target="_blank">University
        of Wisconsin Stout</a> for a year, but I'm currently taking a break as it's not required for my work at the moment.

            <h4>Career Path</h4>
            <p class="flow-text">I'm currently employed full time at Target HQ as an Android Engineer. Before that, I was employed by SkillFitness&reg; in downtown Minneapolis, which started out as independent contracting. Before that, I was employed as the <em>lead Android and iOS developer</em>                for a small startup company in Bloomington, MN called Ricco Solutions. I've been a programmer for 9+ years. In the future, I'd like to start my own app development company, or work for Google.</p>
            <p class="flow-text">You can see evidence of my work and reputation I've gotten from being an active Android developer in the community by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Aidan+Follestad" target="_blank">searching my name on Google</a>.</p>

            <h4>Favorite Quotes</h4>
            <p class="flow-text"><em>&#8220;You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.&#8221;</em> &#8212;
                <span id="highlight">"The Great Dictator"</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flow-text"><em>&#8220;Your time is limited, don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.&#8221;</em>                &#8212; <span id="highlight">Steve Jobs</span></p>
            <p class="flow-text"><em>&#8220;Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.&#8221;</em> &#8212; <span id="highlight">Karl Marx</span></p>
